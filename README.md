# Custom-Encryption
next level encryption

The aim is self defined, encrypting/decrypting files using a very simple & efiicient logic.

## Methodology
Encryption is achieved by creating a character set made of special character for a-z & A-Z.
eg. x='%(-)' & so on. Even the spaces are encrypted so that it's defficult to know the no. of words.

U might be thinking for coincidence matching of special character eg. 'dab' could misconfigure 'erk' but i can assure that odds for that are highly low.

## Usage
`git clone https://github.com/ritik-malik/Custom-Encryption.git`

1st change the permission using chmod +x encryption.sh
Then run the file:

`./encryption.sh` or `bash encryption.sh`

Rest is upto u...  :)

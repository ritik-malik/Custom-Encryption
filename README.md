# Custom-Encryption
next level encryption

The aim is self defined, encrypting/decrypting files.

## Methodology
Encryption is achieved by creating a character set made of special character for a-z & A-Z.
eg. x='%(-)' & so on. Even the spaces are encrypted so that it's defficult to know the no. of words.

U might be thinking for coincidence matching of special character eg. 'dab' could misconfigure 'erk' but i can assure that odds for that are highly low.

## Usage
`git clone https://github.com/ritik-malik/Custom-Encryptyion`

Then run the binary file in terminal:

`./encryption.sh.x`

Rest is upto u...  :)
